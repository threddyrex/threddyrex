# Welcome!

Threddy ðŸ¦– started in 2017, mostly by accident. I tweeted a gif of a ceramic dinosaur and joked that he could be a mascot for our twitter group. I expected the joke to last one day, however it's been years and I'm still pretending to be a dinosaur on the internet.

# Connect with me

I spend most of my time on Mastodon. I have two accounts:

# Read the comics

Since 2018 I've been creating a comic with Threddy and his pals. You can view them here:

I took screenshots of a few posts that are part of Threddy history.
